## Installing Dependencies

If you are using Amazon Linux, you can create a script from the following shell commands that should install the dependencies.

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
rm -Rf aws
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
cat << EOF >> /home/ec2-user/.bash_profile
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
EOF
source /home/ec2-user/.bash_profile
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
npm install -g npm nodejs typescript aws-sdk aws-cdk
```

However, always refer to the documentation for all relevant packages for installation instructions.
